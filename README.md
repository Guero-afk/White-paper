Page 1 – Mechanics

 This section outlines general token launch mechanics commonly seen on platforms such as Pump.fun. This material is included strictly for structure and educational clarity and does not indicate any financial promises or expectations. 

1. Bonding Curve Basics – A bonding curve determines token prices algorithmically. Early buyers generally pay less, and later buyers pay more. The curve represents a smooth progression toward liquidity deployment.

 2. Liquidity Deployment – Once the bonding curve completes, the platform typically deploys liquidity automatically to a decentralized exchange (DEX), pairing SOL/token. This liquidity is locked and cannot be withdrawn by the creator. 

3. Trading Functionality – After deployment, trading happens entirely on the DEX. Prices fluctuate based on community interest, participation, and market activity. 

4. Creator Fees – A small percentage of buys and sells often accumulate as creator fees. These can be claimed only once the bonding curve has fully completed. These fees are not guaranteed and depend entirely on trading activity. 

5. No Native Utility – Standard meme tokens launched on Pump.fun have no inherent utility unless the creator adds external features later. BLING adheres to this norm, functioning purely as entertainment. 

6. Volatility – Bonding curve launches are inherently volatile. Prices may swing unpredictably. This is normal and expected, and users must treat all participation as entertainment only. 

7. Community Dynamics – Most mechanics ultimately depend on community participation. Visibility, interactions, and social content drive the experience more than any built-in function. These mechanics shape the environment in which BLING launches but do NOT guarantee performance or outcomes of any kind

Page 3 – Developer Limitations & No Guarantees BLING is the developer’s first project. There are no guarantees of expertise, reliability, or long-term maintenance. Participants should not expect polished systems or professional-level infrastructure. The developer may encounter unexpected issues such as delays, misconfigurations, or feature changes. No roadmap is guaranteed. Everything is experimental. BLING is purely an entertainment project. Nothing here should ever be interpreted as financial advice or an investment guarantee. Users may lose money, and all participation should be considered optional and for fun only.

















Page 4 – Developer Allocation & Expanded Mechanics For full transparency, the developer may hold up to 30% of the token supply at launch. This allocation is not financial in nature and should not be interpreted as an indicator of future performance. It exists for operational reasons such as content production, livestream preparation, meme creation, social presence maintenance, and giveaway events. 

Expanded Mechanics: 1. Narrative Recursion – BLING's story unfolds through livestream events. These events introduce new memes, new characters, and community-influenced directions. This continuous evolution differentiates BLING from static meme projects. 

2. Voting Influence – Token holders may participate in narrative decisions, comedic events, and livestream choices. This system is not tied to any economic return—only story participation.

 3. Event-Based Momentum – BLING thrives when community participation intensifies around scheduled events. Livestreams act as energy hubs that renew the narrative and refresh engagement cycles. 

4. Multi Narrative Layering – Instead of relying on a single concept, BLING introduces multiple themes over time. This prevents stagnation and extends the project's entertainment lifespan. 

5. Social Amplification – Community missions, raid events, and content submissions contribute to visibility. These mechanics do not guarantee market outcomes but strengthen the entertainment loop. This page establishes internal structure only, not financial direction.



3.1 Advanced Pump.fun Mechanics & Community Engagement
BLING leverages additional Pump.fun mechanics to enhance community participation, hype, and narrative interaction. These mechanisms are educational and entertainment-focused, not financial:
3.1.1 Top Holder Influence
Top holders (addresses holding the largest BLING balances) are given special interactive privileges during live events.


Privileges include voting on narrative outcomes, selecting event directions, or triggering themed content drops.


This creates a sense of ownership and community leadership without affecting token economics.


3.1.2 Raiders & Social Amplification
Raiders are community members who participate in coordinated social engagement campaigns around BLING content.


Typical actions include liking, sharing, and commenting on AI-generated posts during time-limited events.


Successful raids increase visibility, drive hype, and attract paid promotional opportunities for BLING on social platforms.


Raiders may also be rewarded with non-financial incentives, such as NFT collectibles, badges, or recognition in community channels.


3.1.3 Paid Promotion Integration
BLING uses the attention generated by raids to justify paid social amplification.


Promotional campaigns are designed to increase engagement metrics, grow audience participation, and feed back into the narrative loop.


All advertising aligns with the community-driven theme of entertainment, reinforcing storylines and interactive events.

The BLING token follows standard Pump.fun launch mechanics, where early buyers purchase at lower prices and later buyers pay more according to a bonding curve. For example, the initial price may start at 0.01 SOL per BLING, rising to 0.03 SOL after 50% of the total supply is sold, and reaching 0.10 SOL upon curve completion. Each transaction contributes a creator fee, typically around 2%, meaning that if 10,000 SOL is traded during the launch, approximately 200 SOL will accumulate as creator fees. These fees remain in the Pump.fun system until the bonding curve is complete, at which point they can be claimed by the developer or used for community-driven activities. Once the curve completes, liquidity is automatically deployed to a BLING/SOL pool on a decentralized exchange, with an example allocation of 70% of the accumulated funds for liquidity provision and 30% reserved for developer operations, such as content creation, livestreams, giveaways, or narrative-driven events. Curve completion is typically triggered when either a predefined number of tokens, for instance 100,000 BLING, is sold or a target trading volume, such as 50 SOL, is reached. Before this threshold, the token exists entirely within the Pump.fun environment; after threshold completion, it can operate independently on a DEX, enabling community engagement and additional interactive mechanics. BLING may also integrate engagement-linked incentives post-curve completion, allowing top holders to influence narrative outcomes during live events and enabling raiders to participate in coordinated social campaigns that drive visibility and hype, with rewards proportionally distributed to top contributors.























Page 5 – Legal & Safety Summary Participation in BLING is optional and carries risk. BLING is not a financial instrument, not an investment, and not a promise of any future value. It exists purely for entertainment and narrative-based community engagement. All users must acknowledge the unpredictability of online token activity. Prices can move rapidly, and outcomes cannot be controlled. BLING provides no warranties or commitments. Treat BLING as digital entertainment—nothing more. End of revised documentation
